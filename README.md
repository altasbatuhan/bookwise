# Bookwise

Bookwise is a web-based application to manage and discover books, with an added **AI-powered book recommendation system** that suggests books based on user preferences and reading history. The project consists of three main components:

- **Frontend**: React-based user interface
- **Backend**: Flask Restful API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

The application is containerized using Docker.

## Features

- **View Books:** See books along with their details.
- **Category-based Book View:** View books filtered by selected categories.
- **Favorites:** Add books to your favorites list for quick access.
- **Ratings:** Rate books to provide feedback and help others.
- **User Account Management:** Change your username and password.
- **Account Deletion:** Permanently delete your account from the system.
- **Recommendations:** Based on the books youâ€™ve rated, liked, and the categories you choose, you can activate the AI switch to get AI-powered book suggestions. Alternatively, you can view books directly from your selected categories.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React for a seamless mobile and desktop experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on your system.

    docker-compose up 
   ```

This command will automatically:

  Start the PostgreSQL Database (bookwise-db service).
